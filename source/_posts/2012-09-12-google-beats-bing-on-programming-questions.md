If you have been keeping up with the search engines of late you probably know that Bing has challenged Googe to a [Side-by-Side Search Off]({{ 'http://www.bingiton.com/' | bitly }}). We took the challenge and decided to search for things that matter the most to us, such as programming related questions.

As you can see, Google won out on all but one search.

**Conclusion:** the simpler your search, the better Bing appears to be, especially for non-programming related questions. If you work in the software/web industry, you will probably want to stick with Google for the foreseeable future!
