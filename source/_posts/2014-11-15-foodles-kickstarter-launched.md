New Kickstarter launched! Foodl.es keeps all your favorite family recipes at your fingertips, no matter where your family meal traditions take you.

<!-- more -->

We at Xorcode finally fired up our [Kickstarter for Foodles](http://kck.st/1veSwLo)! Having been busy with other projects it took us a while, but it's finally here and we are ready to rock this project out.

> Foodl.es isn’t just another online cookbook. We’ve taken the basic ingredients that you find in all cookbooks and thrown out the recipe. With a focus on preserving your family traditions it is something entirely special. So much of our family traditions are tied to food and meals shared with our loved ones. Foodl.es is not just a place to collect and organize your recipes, but also the preservation of family traditions by offering you the ability to attach a story, video or pictures to an individual recipe.
> 
> We know that you don’t always want to share your family recipes, so all your recipes default to private and can be shared at your choosing, not ours. With different subscription levels you can customize your account to fit your needs. Our Individual Package, well, it’s pretty explanatory. The Family Package opens up collaborating with other users to share recipes and create a family cookbook. Our Community Package is perfect for larger groups that want to create a shared cookbook. All cookbooks can be stored online or sent to a printer for publication.

Help us spread the word and by backing the [Foodles](http://kck.st/1veSwLo) project on Kickstarter!
