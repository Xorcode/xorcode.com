We can't stop targeted hacking, but we *can* stop mass surveillance, by building proven security into the everyday Internet. Join us and others for [#ResetTheNet](https://www.resetthenet.org/) on June 5th where we promote free, open source tools for end-to-end encryption.

## What can I do?

By June 5th, do something to reset your part of the web. What's the most you can do to block mass surveillance? For sites and apps, the first step is securing the connection between you and your users. For anyone with an audience, or a circle of friends, the best thing you can do is promote a end-to-end encryption (there are some really easy-to-use tools for that now, but they need promotion). For visionary geeks, sky's the limit. Think big!

Get started now and read up on [HSTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) and [PFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy).
