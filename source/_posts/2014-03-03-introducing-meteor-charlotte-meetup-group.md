Earlier this year we at Xorcode started a [meetup group]({{ 'http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-Charlotte' | bitly }}) for people interested in Meteor in Charlotte, NC. We had a pretty decent turnout the first meeting, with thirteen Meteorites in attendance. We've got several more meetings planned along with a hackathon.

<!-- more -->

So far we're 28 Meteorites and growing. We've got a Hackathon planned for <a href="{{ 'http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-Charlotte/events/164415842/' | bitly }}"><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> March 10th, 2014 at 6:30pm</a> where we will begin hacking on an application that will benefit the local community in some way.

Do you have ideas for the next, cool local application that can help the people of Charlotte in their daily lives? If so, join our Hackathon and help us figure out what to build!
