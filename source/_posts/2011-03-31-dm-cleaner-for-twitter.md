Cleaning your Twitter direct messages manually can be a hassle and consume a lot of your time. [DM Cleaner](http://dm-cleaner.com/) can wipe your Direct Message inbox **and** Sent Messages in one fell swoop.

DM Cleaner indexes your direct messages and stores only the ID of the direct message. The indexed messages are stored in a queue and any subsequent messages you receive will not be affected. Once the the application processes your queue all queued messages are deleted from twitter.
