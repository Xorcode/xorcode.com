We will be hacking on an app or service that provides value to Charlotte and the local communities here as a project where we can get to know Meteor in depth from idea to deployment and production environment configuration.

<!-- more -->

Please join us and other developers and designers from Charlotte as we create something cool for fun and for our own education!

We will be providing food and drink for all Meteorites that attend. If you have any dietary preferences, please contact either Torgny or Jill so that we can plan accordingly.

Scott Deeter has volunteered to lead this hackathon. He has a bit of work done on the concept for a Craigslist clone and can help us all get started learning Meteor!

We are looking forward to joining with others to learn more about Meteor and its awesome features.
